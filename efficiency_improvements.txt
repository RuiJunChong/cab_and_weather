Optimisations to be considered to improve efficiency:

- Utilising JavaScript for frontend while maintaining Flask as backend
    ==> JavaScript has frameworks like React for easier and faster development.
	==> Tailwind CSS can also be used with JavaScript for easier UI building.
	
- Using Apache Airflow to schedule tasks
    ==> It allows parallelism in task execution for better resource utilisation.
